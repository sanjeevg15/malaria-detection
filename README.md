# Adversarially Robust Model for Malaria Detection 

This repository utilizes an ensemble of three Convolutional Neural Networks to predict whether or not a histopathological image of a cell is malarial. The diversity of the individual models provides a layer of defense against adversarial attacks using the FGSM technique. The dataset used for this study is a collection of 27588 segmented cell images acquired at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh.
